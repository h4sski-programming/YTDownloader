# Application to download mp3 files from YT

- open `input.txt` file and add links to the file.
- run program
- downloaded `.mp3` files will be stored inside `download` folder
- downloaded urls as a log will be copied in file `output.txt`

Uploaded links will not be removed from `input.txt` file.


### Ideas for to-do

1. Cross check input and output file if all has beed downloaded propperly. If not then print message with not downloaded urls and titles.
2. After download remove url from the list/file. Most probably this would require creation of new file "temp".
